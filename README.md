üå§Ô∏è Weather App using React.js

This is a simple and responsive weather application built with React.js. It allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather updates including temperature, humidity, and wind speed using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app also dynamically updates weather icons based on the current weather condition.

Tools and Technologies Used

* React.js with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
* OpenWeatherMap API (for live weather data)
* Fetch API (for HTTP requests)
* Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsiveness)

Features

* Search weather by entering a city name
* Displays:

  * Temperature (in Celsius)
  * Humidity (percentage)
  * Wind speed (in km/h)
* Automatically shows weather for Kolkata on first load
* Dynamic weather icons based on real-time data
* Error handling for invalid or empty input

React Hooks Used

useRef
Used to capture input from the user without triggering re-renders.

useState
